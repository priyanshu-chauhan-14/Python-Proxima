# This is a program to show how string can be defined in python

# 1. String can be defined with single quotes.
# Example 1: 

print('Hello Prateek')

# 2. String can be defined with double quotes.
# Example 2: 
print("\n")
print("Hello Prateek")

# 3. String can be defined with triple single quotes. Triple single quotes allows us to create strings that spans in multiple lines.
# Example 3: 
print("\n")
print('''    Johny Johny ! 
    Yes papa !
    Eating sugar ! 
    No papa !''')

# 4 Example no. 4 can also be written without the use of triple single quote but for this we need to use escape sequence --> \n (new line) --> It add a new line wherever it is written 
# Example 5: 
print("\n")
print(" Twinkle, Twinkle, little star, \n How I wonder what you are ! \n Up above the world so high \n Like a diamond in the sky")
